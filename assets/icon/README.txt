Place your square PNG icon here as `app_icon.png`.

Recommended source image:
- Size: 1024x1024 pixels
- Format: PNG
- No rounded corners (system will mask as needed)

After adding the file, run:

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons:main
```

This will generate launcher icons for Android, iOS, and Windows (if enabled).
